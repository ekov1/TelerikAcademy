# RoomMeasurer
WindowsUniversal teamwork project

## Description

RoomMeasurer is an app that lets you quickly scan the floor plan of a room by taking photos of each corner. You can also calculate the real size and distance of an object based on a relevant reference in a photo. The object and reference must be at equal distance from the camera and the calculated side must be parallel to the camera plane.

## TODO

### Priority list
- Implement instruction notifier for room measurer
- Video on Youtube

### Extras list
- Remote data saving (saved plans in the cloud)
- Local db data saving (locally saved plans)
- option for saving plan locally or in the cloud
- Gestures (moving tapped dots)
- Tap ellipse identification (measure smaller than reference objects)
